- it does this
- it does this 


The CmpSpMfile directory stores matrices in compressed form.

### **How to Compile and Run**

"$$$$Sample text: This project does not use a GUI, instead it relies on command line arguments for input and will spit out .txt files as an output.  Download the project, create a .txt file containing the sorting you are using into the SpMfile directory.  Now just update the main functions of COO.cpp and LlL.cpp to take in however many CLAs you want and what you want the to do with the lists that are created.""
