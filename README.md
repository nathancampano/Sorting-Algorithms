<h2 align="center"> Data Structure: Sorting Algorithms </h2>

Sorting algorithms can be seen as a quintessential part of data structures. A sorting algorithm rearranges data elements within an array or list in accordance with a comparison operator. The comparison operator determines why certain elements are in the new order within a data structure. In essence, sorting algorithms are methods to reorganize data sets or items into a specific order. Such orders consist of numerical values of high to low, distance between shortest to longest, or alphabetical order. The process in which the algorithm analyzes a data set by taking in a list of items as input data, reads it, and performs a specific operation based on the type of sorting algorithm used. After the operation is performed on the list of data, it is outputted as an ordered array. Sorting algorithms are used in numerous applications including but not limited to organizing medical documents, ecommerce and retail pricing, entertainment programming based on view time and engagements, determining relevant search engine results, and operational research.
 

### **File Descriptions**

#### 1. xxx-file & directories 

"This file is..."
- it does this
- it does this
- it does this 

---

#### 2. xxx-file

"File contains function that does this..."

---

### **Methods**

#### 1. Print Vector Function 

This function was simply used by our group in order to print an array of whatever size input we put in manually or from a text file. This can be seen at the completion of our code since we either output the sorted data to a text file or we just display the data before running and after running, unsorted vs. sorted. 2

#### 2.  Inssetion Sort Function 

 The first sorting function we implemented into our program was the insertion sort function. We chose this as our first due to the ability to easily understand what is happening throughout the entire sorting process. To implement this specific type into our code we knew we had to, of course, include a method of tracking our runtime for the algorithm which resulted in our group using the <chrono> library. Specifically, we used the steady_clock function which represents a monotonic clock, a clock whose time points only increase and where the time between ticks is constant, making it the most suitable for measuring intervals. We then did the actual sorting by looking at the demo provided from lecture and building off that in our own way by instead using a while loop within our for loop. This function ends, which youâ€™ll notice in the other sorts as well, by ending the clock, printing out the new sorted vector, and providing us with many different variables of speed starting from nanoseconds to seconds.

### **Implementation: How to Compile and Run**

"$$$$Sample text: This project does not use a GUI, instead it relies on command line arguments for input and will spit out .txt files as an output.  Download the project, create a .txt file containing the sorting you are using into the SpMfile directory.  Now just update the main functions of COO.cpp and LlL.cpp to take in however many CLAs you want and what you want the to do with the lists that are created.""
